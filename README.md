For this project I was required to make a timed word quiz. I made this quiz centered around a few questions based on the popular franchise, Pokemon. For this assignment I was supposed to have a timer. If a user runs out of time, it displays that their time is up. After that it also shows them their total score for what they answered prior to the questions being done. Each incorrect or correct answer is followed by the appropriate prompt. The total possible score is 100 and each question is worth 25. I was unable to figure out how to display a highscores list with a username input. For some reason my score was also going above the total possible and I had to compensate within my javascript to show the correct total. I made this project with the help of my teacher and study group.
